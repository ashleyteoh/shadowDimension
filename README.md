# Shadow Dimension

A 2D fighting game with between Fae and Demons, themes influenced by the Netflix show Stranger Things

_A dark evil has arrived in your hometown. A group of government scientists have opened a gate in
their laboratory to another dimension called the Over Under. The Over Under is ruled by Navec
(an evil creature of immense power) and his henchmen are called demons. The scientists thought
they could control these creatures but alas they failed and are being held captive in the Over Under.
Navec has created sinkholes that will destroy the lab and is planning on eventually destroying your
world.
The player’s name is Fae, the daughter of one of the scientists. In order to save your father and
your town, you need to avoid the sinkholes, find the gate in the lab and defeat Navec & his demons
in the Over Under. . . ”_




## First level 
Finding the gate in the lab. The player will be able to control Fae who has to move around the walls and avoid any sinkholes that are in the lab. If the player falls into a sinkhole, the player will lose health points. To win, the player has to get to the gate, located in the bottom right of the window. If the player’s health reduces to 0, the game ends.

## Second level
Fae is now in the Over Under. To win the level
and the game, the player must fight and defeat Navec. However, the player has to deal with more
sinkholes and demons too. The player can cause damage to the demons and Navec when the player
presses a certain key. Likewise, the demons and Navec can cause damage to the player. The player
will also have to move around trees.
Level 2 will also give the player the opportunity to change the timescale so that the difficulty of
the game can be changed. Pressing a certain key will increase/decrease the speed of the demons
and Navec (this is explained in more detail later). Like in Level 0, the game will end if the player’s
health reduces to 0 or less.
